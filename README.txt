This plugin allows admin to specify legal / illegal characters in the username during the registration. 
Plugin works with normal registration form request and with fast-validate by AJAX.

Admin can add own settings and configures allowed / not allowed chars groups:
    * uppercase
    * lowercase
    * numbers
    * punctuation
    * special chars
    * spaces
